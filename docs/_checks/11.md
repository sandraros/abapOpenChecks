Because breakpoints can only be set per line, so if there are multiple statements per line it makes it difficult to set breakpoints at one of the statements.

For example, in the following line, it's "difficult" to stop when RETURN is reached :

    LOOP AT atoms ASSIGNING <atom>.
      atom->zcollide( EXPORTING atom = <atom> 
        EXCEPTIONS unknown_particle = 1 ).
      IF sy-subrc <> 0 AND stop_lhc_if_unknown_event = abap_true. RETURN. ENDIF.        " <=== 3 statements in one line !
    ENDLOOP.

Instead, the 3 statements should be written in 3 lines, so that it's easy to set a breakpoint at any statement :

    IF sy-subrc <> 0 AND stop_lhc_if_unknown_event = abap_true.
      RETURN.
    ENDIF.
